#MOVIE RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM
This project is about Movie Recommendation System.We can type the name of a movie into an input box, and instantly get recommendations for other movies we might like. 

We have used Google Colab, Python and Pandas to do this project. 
We'll start with the MovieLens 25M dataset, which contains movie reviews and ratings.  Then, we'll build a search engine to find a specific movie title in our data.  We'll then be able to create a recommendation engine to recommend specific movies.

#CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION
We have built a Credit card Fraud Detection system using Machine Learning with Python. 
For this project, we have used the Logistic Regression model.
